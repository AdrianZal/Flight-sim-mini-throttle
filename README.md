- The microcontroller I used is "Waveshare RP2040-Tiny" and the potentiometer I used is "DFRobot DFR0053"<br />
  **The case is modeled to fit those**<br />
  <br />
- 3dModels directory contains .stl files with everything that is needed to make the case plus flat keycaps<br />
  <br />
- CodeForArduinoIDE directory contains the code that you need to upload onto RP2040<br />
  **You wil probably need to change BUTTON_PINS**<br />
